Phase 1 Project

THE BASIC STORY OF THIS APPLICATION
This application will be a SPA where you can look up, browse through, and search for data regarding musicians, instruments, record labels, and more music related entities.

THE CORE FEATURES OF THIS MVP
The core features of my MVP are as follows:
1. Clicking on an item from the list of items displayed at the top will lay out the item’s detailed information, including the artist’s name, genre, and label
2. Submitting a form to add more information about a new artist and their music
3. Pressing the arrow-up key to vote for an artist

THE API DATA BEING USED
The API data I’ll be using is MusicBrainz API. I will use fetch() to obtain the metadata organized and produced by MusicBrainz and use it to display, browse through, and look up on my application.
